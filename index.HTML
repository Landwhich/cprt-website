                    Welcome to the Carleton Planetary Rover Team! Based in Carleton University, 
                    we are a student-led engineering group that designs and builds autonomous rovers for international competitions 
                    such as the CIRC and URC.

        <h1>About Us</h1>
        We are the Carleton Planetary Rover Team, 
        a group of student engineers dedicated to building autonomous rovers that compete internationally. 
        <br><br>
        Our team is made up of students from a diverse range of programs, united by our shared passion. 
        The work is split between five subteams, each crucial to the development of our rover. 
        <br><a class="button">Our Team</a><br>
        The Mechanical Team works on the robot’s design and build. Each year, they develop the chassis, suspension, 
        and robotic arm, making sure they are capable of handling the tough terrain and complex tasks of a simulated Mars.
        <br><br>
        The Electrical Team works on the inner mechanisms, developing the power systems, wiring, 
        and sensors that keep the rover running, regardless of condition.
        <br><br>
        The Science Team focuses on understanding the complex terrain the rover operates in. Using various tools and experiments, 
        they analyze soil and detect resources while simulating real planetary missions. 
        <br><br>
        The Software Team builds autonomy, vision, and control systems that allow the rover to navigate 
        and operate with minimal input.
        <br><br>
        The Business and Administration Team manages sponsorships, outreach and logistics to ensure 
        the team has the adequate resources needed to succeed.

        <h1>Where We Compete</h1>
        The Canadian International Rover Challenge (CIRC) features post-secondary design teams from all around the world. 
        Here, teams simulate early colony life on an extraterrestrial planet, facing the same tasks future rovers are expected to perform.  
        <br><a class="button white">URC</a><br>
        The University Rover Challenge (URC) is the world’s premier robotics competition for college students. 
        Held annually in the southern Utah desert, 
        URC challenges student teams to build the next generation of Mars Rovers that will one day work with the astronauts exploring the Red Planet.
